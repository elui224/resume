  about:  #Required
    paragraph1: Hello! Currently a data analytics manager at athenahealth, a tech platform boasting one of the richest data assets in the healthcare space. At athena, I curate data about interface operations / transactions (EDI) and help athena tell its story by creating data pipelines, developing beautiful dashboards, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and building trust with leadership.
    paragraph2: My professional experience mainly has been focused in the healthcare. However, I've also invested time -- informally at work and at home-- to learn new technologies to improve life and simply for fun. I'm always looking to learn interesting things!
    paragraph3: In my spare time, I like to ball, cycle, and stunt on friends in the Fifa Lounge (a video game).
